# Notes on completing Git Tutorial from Vuorre & Curley (2018) article

# Testing out whether we are pointed to the correct git directory. Some issues arose when we first tried to open a new R Project with git having already been installed. Initially, it looked like the global preferences were pointed to /usr/bin/git, but this did not allow us to establish a new repository and establish version control even though git had been installed. After some googling, we discovered that it was possible that after a new OS update, the directory was not pointed to the correct location. 
# Here are some steps that aided us in figuring out the problem. 
  # 1. In Terminal, type 'which git'
  # 2. This will point to the actual directory where git can be found.
  # 3. Change directory under Global Preferences to the correct directory.
  # 4. It turns out that changing directory is not easy as the files are hidden: use the following command in Terminal to reveal hidden files: 'defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES'
  # 5. Now the directory can be pointed.
# There is an alternative method, although it did not end up working well for us.
  # 1. In Terminal, type 'xcode-select --install'
  # 2. Agree to install.
  # 3. Then this should allow one to use the original git directory that is listed in R Studio. 
# However, this did not work for me. 
# I created two subdirectories and included some empty files in both of them just to illustrate a completed project. 
####New Section
# Continuing on with the article, I am following the section from p. 11.I have now started with creating a new respository in GitHub. The central repository was then linked to a new R project. The article states that you cannot do this in RStudio once a new project is established. However, when creating the new project, you need to add the github link as a directory and create a git repository. Then, I just copied over the old material into the new directory.
